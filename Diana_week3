Answer the following questions considering the learning outcomes for
- [Week 1](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/developer/project-1-server/learning-outcomes/)


## Assessment -> week 3 progress Assessment 
 ### 1. Show evidence of some of the learning outcomes you have achieved this week.
> **[Learning outcomes...]**  
> I learnt how to get and post resources from a server.
that is why you use an API -> it gives you routes to access you data. I learnt about HTTP protocals including
GET
POST
PUT
DELETE
and how to make a dynamic route with a semi colon :id

req.params. 

```
export function FILTERhandler(app: Express) {
	app.get('/filter/:category/:difficulty', async (req, res) => {
		const fileContent = await loadData();
		let Allquestions = fileContent.questions;

		const category = req.params.category as CategoryFilterTypes;
		const difficulty = req.params.difficulty as Difficulty;

		let result = determineFilter(Allquestions, category, difficulty);

		try {
			res.json(result);
			// res.status(200).send('Filter successfully applied!');
		} catch (error) {
			console.log(error);
			res.status(500).send('Error in applying filter');
		}
	});
}

```


I used BRUNO which is a client side API to test if the routes are working correctly. 
 ### 2. Show an example of some of the learning outcomes you have struggled with and/or would like to re-visit.
I still struggle with understanding why you would use ?
